This isn't a library you can borrow software from, but rather just a compendium of known software.  Periodically, NIST will publish MD5 hashes of all the software in the NSRL.  These lists of hashes are called the Reference Data Set (RDS).\r\n\r\n### Why is it important?\r\nDigital forensics has a huge needle-and-haystack problem.  Out of hundreds of gigabytes of data you're really only interested in a very small fraction of it.  As a general rule, things that are in the NSRL are generally not going to be interesting to an investigator.  Separating things into \"known to NIST\" and \"unknown to NIST\" is a good first step in an investigation: it lets you focus on the more interesting things.  It's not going to be a \"Find Evidence!\" button, but it might reduce the files you have to look at by an order of magnitude -- and that's a wonderful thing.\r\n\r\n### Aren't there already tools for this?\r\nSure!  [nsrllookup](http://nsrlquery.sf.net), which I wrote, does this same thing.  But nsrllookup is a purely command-line tool, and some people hate having to chain commands together with pipes, grep through output, and so forth.  Some people want a nice, convenient GUI.  And that's what Duffy provides.\r\n\r\n### Where can I get precompiled binaries?\r\nLook inside the binaries/ subdirectory.  You'll find precompiled binaries for Win32, OS X, and a couple of flavors of Linux.\r\n\r\n### What are the licensing terms?\r\nDuffy uses Qt, which is provided under the Lesser GPL.  Duffy itself is released under the ISC License.  The short version is, \"you are free to use it, to share it with others, and to make modifications to the source code.\"\r\n","tagline":"Easy querying of NIST's database of MD5 hashes"}
